# Instructions

This app accesses the gfycat api and requires a client-id and client-secret to do so. These are private and not in git. But you can add them yourself.
1. In the root directory, create a file and call it "gfycat.properties"
2. In that file, add the following:
```
GFYCAT_CLIENT_ID="{your_client_id}"
GFYCAT_CLIENT_SECRET="{your_client_secret}"
```
3. Save that file and you are good to go!
4. Open the app in Android Studio and run!
